Note [FamInsts and CoAxioms]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* CoAxioms and FamInsts are just like
  DFunIds  and ClsInsts

* A CoAxiom is a System-FC thing: it can relate any two types

* A FamInst is a Haskell source-language thing, corresponding
  to a type/data family instance declaration.
    - The FamInst contains a CoAxiom, which is the evidence
      for the instance

    - The LHSs of the CoAxiom branches are always of form
      F ty1 .. tyn where F is a type family

* A FamInstBranch corresponds to a CoAxBranch -- it represents
  one alternative in a family instance group. We could theoretically
  not have FamInstBranches and just use the CoAxBranches within
  the CoAxiom stored in the FamInst, but for one problem: we want to
  cache the "rough match" top-level tycon names for quick matching.
  This data is not stored in a CoAxBranch, so we use FamInstBranches
  instead.

Note [fi_group field]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A FamInst stores whether or not it was declared with "type instance where"
for two reasons: 
  1. for accurate pretty-printing; and 
  2. because confluent overlap is disallowed between branches 
     declared in groups. 
Note that this "group-ness" is properly associated with the FamInst,
which thinks about overlap, and not in the CoAxiom, which blindly
assumes that it is part of a consistent axiom set.

A "group" with fi_group=True can have just one element, however.

Note [Why we need fib_rhs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It may at first seem unnecessary to store the right-hand side of an equation
in a FamInstBranch. After all, FamInstBranches are used only for matching a
family application; the underlying CoAxiom is used to perform the actual
simplification.

However, we do need to know the rhs field during conflict checking to support
confluent overlap. When two unbranched instances have overlapping left-hand
sides, we check if the right-hand sides are coincident in the region of overlap.
This check requires fib_rhs. See lookupFamInstEnvConflicts.

Note [Lazy axiom match]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is Vitally Important that mkImportedFamInst is *lazy* in its axiom
parameter. The axiom is loaded lazily, via a forkM, in TcIface. Sometime
later, mkImportedFamInst is called using that axiom. However, the axiom
may itself depend on entities which are not yet loaded as of the time
of the mkImportedFamInst. Thus, if mkImportedFamInst eagerly looks at the
axiom, a dependency loop spontaneously appears and GHC hangs. The solution
is simply for mkImportedFamInst never, ever to look inside of the axiom
until everything else is good and ready to do so. We can assume that this
readiness has been achieved when some other code pulls on the axiom in the
FamInst. Thus, we pattern match on the axiom lazily (in the where clause,
not in the parameter list) and we assert the consistency of names there
also.

\begin{code}

-- Make a family instance representation from the information found in an
-- interface file.  In particular, we get the rough match info from the iface
-- (instead of computing it here).
mkImportedFamInst :: Name               -- Name of the family

Note [FamInstEnv]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A FamInstEnv maps a family name to the list of known instances for that family.

The same FamInstEnv includes both 'data family' and 'type family' instances.
Type families are reduced during type inference, but not data families;
the user explains when to use a data family instance by using contructors
and pattern matching.

Neverthless it is still useful to have data families in the FamInstEnv:

 - For finding overlaps and conflicts

 - For finding the representation type...see FamInstEnv.topNormaliseType
   and its call site in Simplify

 - In standalone deriving instance Eq (T [Int]) we need to find the
   representation type for T [Int]

\begin{code}
type FamInstEnv = UniqFM FamilyInstEnv  -- Maps a family to its instances
     -- See Note [FamInstEnv]

type FamInstEnvs = (FamInstEnv, FamInstEnv)
     -- External package inst-env, Home-package inst-env

newtype FamilyInstEnv
  = FamIE [FamInst Branched] -- The instances for a particular family, in any order

instance Outputable FamilyInstEnv where
  ppr (FamIE fs) = ptext (sLit "FamIE") <+> vcat (map ppr fs)

-- INVARIANTS:
--  * The fs_tvs are distinct in each FamInst
--      of a range value of the map (so we can safely unify them)

@lookupFamInstEnv@ looks up in a @FamInstEnv@, using a one-way match.
Multiple matches are only possible in case of type families (not data
families), and then, it doesn't matter which match we choose (as the
instances are guaranteed confluent).

We return the matching family instances and the type instance at which it
matches.  For example, if we lookup 'T [Int]' and have a family instance

  data instance T [a] = ..

desugared to

  data :R42T a = ..
  coe :Co:R42T a :: T [a] ~ :R42T a

we return the matching instance '(FamInst{.., fi_tycon = :R42T}, Int)'.

Note [Instance checking within groups]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following:

type instance where
  F Int = Bool
  F a   = Int

g :: Show a => a -> F a
g x = length (show x)

Should that type-check? No. We need to allow for the possibility
that 'a' might be Int and therefore 'F a' should be Bool. We can
simplify 'F a' to Int only when we can be sure that 'a' is not Int.

To achieve this, after finding a possible match within an instance group, we
have to go back to all previous FamInstBranchess and check that, under the
substitution induced by the match, other matches are not possible. This is
similar to what happens with class instance selection, when we need to
guarantee that there is only a match and no unifiers. The exact algorithm is
different here because the the potentially-overlapping group is closed.

ALTERNATE APPROACH: As we are processing the branches, we could check if an
instance unifies but does not match. If this happens, there is no possible
match and we can fail right away. This might be more efficient.

Note [Early failure optimisation for instance groups]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As we're searching through the instances for a match, it is
possible that we find an branch within an instance that matches, but
a previous branch still unifies. In this case, we can abort the
search, because any other instance that matches will necessarily
overlap with the instance group we're currently searching. Because
overlap among instance groups is disallowed, we know that that
no such other instance exists.

Note [Confluence checking within groups]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GHC allows type family instances to have overlapping patterns as long as the
right-hand sides are coincident in the region of overlap. Can we extend this
notion of confluent overlap to branched instances? Not in any obvious way.

Consider this:

type instance where
  F Int = Int
  F a = a

Without confluence checking (in other words, as implemented), we cannot now
simplify an application of (F b) -- b might unify with Int later on, so this
application is stuck. However, it would seem easy to just check that, in the
region of overlap, (i.e. b |-> Int), the right-hand sides coincide, so we're
OK. The problem happens when we are simplifying an application (F (G a)),
where (G a) is stuck. What, now, is the region of overlap? We can't soundly
simplify (F (G a)) without knowing that the right-hand sides are confluent
in the region of overlap, but we also can't in any obvious way identify the
region of overlap. We don't want to do analysis on the instances of G, because
that is not sound in a world with open type families. (If G were known to be
closed, there might be a way forward here.) To find the region of overlap,
it is conceivable that we might convert (G a) to some fresh type variable and
then unify, but we must be careful to convert every (G a) to the same fresh
type variable. And then, what if there is an (H a) lying around? It all seems
rather subtle, error-prone, confusing, and probably won't help anyone. So,
we're not doing it.

So, why is this not a problem with non-branched confluent overlap? Because
we don't need to verify that an application is apart from anything. The
non-branched confluent overlap check happens when we add the instance to the
environment -- we're unifying among patterns, which cannot contain type family
appplications. So, we're safe there and can continue supporting that feature.

Note [lookup_fam_inst_env' implementation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To reduce code duplication, both lookups during simplification and conflict
checking are routed through lookup_fam_inst_env', which looks for a
matching/unifying branch compared to some target. In the simplification
case, the search is for a match for a target application; in the conflict-
checking case, the search is for a unifier for a putative new instance branch.

The two uses are differentiated by different MatchFuns, which look at a given
branch to see if it is relevant and whether the search should continue. The
the branch is relevant (i.e. matches or unifies), Just subst is
returned; if the instance is not relevant, Nothing is returned. The MatchFun
also indicates what the search algorithm should do next: it could
KeepSearching or StopSearching.

When to StopSearching? See Note [Early failure optimisation for instance groups]

For class instances, these two variants of lookup are combined into one
function (cf, @InstEnv@).  We don't do that for family instances as the
results of matching and unification are used in two different contexts.
Moreover, matching is the wildly more frequently used operation in the case of
indexed synonyms and we don't want to slow that down by needless unification.

Note [Family instance overlap conflicts]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- In the case of data family instances, any overlap is fundamentally a
  conflict (as these instances imply injective type mappings).

- In the case of type family instances, overlap is admitted as long as
  the neither instance declares an instance group and the right-hand
  sides of the overlapping rules coincide under the overlap substitution.
  For example:
       type instance F a Int = a
       type instance F Int b = b
  These two overlap on (F Int Int) but then both RHSs are Int,
  so all is well. We require that they are syntactically equal;
  anything else would be difficult to test for at this stage.

Note [Over-saturated matches]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's ok to look up an over-saturated type constructor.  E.g.
     type family F a :: * -> *
     type instance F (a,b) = Either (a->b)

The type instance gives rise to a newtype TyCon (at a higher kind
which you can't do in Haskell!):
     newtype FPair a b = FP (Either (a->b))

Then looking up (F (Int,Bool) Char) will return a FamInstMatch
     (FPair, [Int,Bool,Char])

The "extra" type argument [Char] just stays on the end.

-- in other words, if an application would match the first LHS, it is guaranteed
-- to match at least one of the others. The RHSs are ignored.

--   False -> no information
-- It is currently (Oct 2012) used only for generating errors for
