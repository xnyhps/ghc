Note [Basic Simplifier Plan] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Pick an element from the WorkList if there exists one with depth 
   less thanour context-stack depth. 

2. Run it down the 'stage' pipeline. Stages are: 
      - canonicalization
      - inert reactions
      - spontaneous reactions
      - top-level intreactions
   Each stage returns a StopOrContinue and may have sideffected 
   the inerts or worklist.
  
   The threading of the stages is as follows: 
      - If (Stop) is returned by a stage then we start again from Step 1. 
      - If (ContinueWith ct) is returned by a stage, we feed 'ct' on to 
        the next stage in the pipeline. 
4. If the element has survived (i.e. ContinueWith x) the last stage 
   then we add him in the inerts and jump back to Step 1.

If in Step 1 no such element exists, we have exceeded our context-stack 
depth and will simply fail.

Note [Spontaneously solved in TyBinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we encounter a constraint ([W] alpha ~ tau) which can be spontaneously solved,
we record the equality on the TyBinds of the TcSMonad. In the past, we used to also
add a /given/ version of the constraint ([G] alpha ~ tau) to the inert
canonicals -- and potentially kick out other equalities that mention alpha.

Then, the flattener only had to look in the inert equalities during flattening of a
type (TcCanonical.flattenTyVar).

However it is a bit silly to record these equalities /both/ in the inerts AND the
TyBinds, so we have now eliminated spontaneously solved equalities from the inerts,
and only record them in the TyBinds of the TcS monad. The flattener is now consulting
these binds /and/ the inerts for potentially unsolved or other given equalities.

Note [Kick out insolubles]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have an insoluble alpha ~ [alpha], which is insoluble
because an occurs check.  And then we unify alpha := [Int].  
Then we really want to rewrite the insouluble to [Int] ~ [[Int]].
Now it can be decomposed.  Otherwise we end up with a "Can't match
[Int] ~ [[Int]]" which is true, but a bit confusing because the
outer type constructors match. 

Note [Delicate equality kick-out]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
When adding an equality (a ~ xi), we kick out an inert type-variable 
equality (b ~ phi) in two cases

(1) If the new tyvar can rewrite the kind LHS or RHS of the inert
    equality.  Example:
    Work item: [W] k ~ *
    Inert:     [W] (a:k) ~ ty        
               [W] (b:*) ~ c :: k
    We must kick out those blocked inerts so that we rewrite them
    and can subsequently unify.

(2) If the new tyvar can 
          Work item:  [G] a ~ b
          Inert:      [W] b ~ [a]
    Now at this point the work item cannot be further rewritten by the
    inert (due to the weaker inert flavor). But we can't add the work item
    as-is because the inert set would then have a cyclic substitution, 
    when rewriting a wanted type mentioning 'a'. So we must kick the inert out. 

    We have to do this only if the inert *cannot* rewrite the work item;
    it it can, then the work item will have been fully rewritten by the 
    inert during canonicalisation.  So for example:
         Work item: [W] a ~ Int
         Inert:     [W] b ~ [a]
    No need to kick out the inert, beause the inert substitution is not
    necessarily idemopotent.  See Note [Non-idempotent inert substitution].

Note [Kind errors] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the wanted problem: 
      alpha ~ (# Int, Int #) 
where alpha :: ArgKind and (# Int, Int #) :: (#). We can't spontaneously solve this constraint, 
but we should rather reject the program that give rise to it. If 'trySpontaneousEqTwoWay' 
simply returns @CantSolve@ then that wanted constraint is going to propagate all the way and 
get quantified over in inference mode. That's bad because we do know at this point that the 
constraint is insoluble. Instead, we call 'recKindErrorTcS' here, which will fail later on.

The same applies in canonicalization code in case of kind errors in the givens. 

However, when we canonicalize givens we only check for compatibility (@compatKind@). 
If there were a kind error in the givens, this means some form of inconsistency or dead code.

You may think that when we spontaneously solve wanteds we may have to look through the 
bindings to determine the right kind of the RHS type. E.g one may be worried that xi is 
@alpha@ where alpha :: ? and a previous spontaneous solving has set (alpha := f) with (f :: *).
But we orient our constraints so that spontaneously solved ones can rewrite all other constraint
so this situation can't happen. 

Note [Spontaneous solving and kind compatibility] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that our canonical constraints insist that *all* equalities (tv ~
xi) or (F xis ~ rhs) require the LHS and the RHS to have *compatible*
the same kinds.  ("compatible" means one is a subKind of the other.)

  - It can't be *equal* kinds, because
     b) wanted constraints don't necessarily have identical kinds
               eg   alpha::? ~ Int
     b) a solved wanted constraint becomes a given

  - SPJ thinks that *given* constraints (tv ~ tau) always have that
    tau has a sub-kind of tv; and when solving wanted constraints
    in trySpontaneousEqTwoWay we re-orient to achieve this.

  - Note that the kind invariant is maintained by rewriting.
    Eg wanted1 rewrites wanted2; if both were compatible kinds before,
       wanted2 will be afterwards.  Similarly givens.

Caveat:
  - Givens from higher-rank, such as: 
          type family T b :: * -> * -> * 
          type instance T Bool = (->) 

          f :: forall a. ((T a ~ (->)) => ...) -> a -> ... 
          flop = f (...) True 
     Whereas we would be able to apply the type instance, we would not be able to 
     use the given (T Bool ~ (->)) in the body of 'flop' 


Note [Avoid double unifications] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The spontaneous solver has to return a given which mentions the unified unification
variable *on the left* of the equality. Here is what happens if not: 
  Original wanted:  (a ~ alpha),  (alpha ~ Int) 
We spontaneously solve the first wanted, without changing the order! 
      given : a ~ alpha      [having unified alpha := a] 
Now the second wanted comes along, but he cannot rewrite the given, so we simply continue.
At the end we spontaneously solve that guy, *reunifying*  [alpha := Int] 

We avoid this problem by orienting the resulting given so that the unification
variable is on the left.  [Note that alternatively we could attempt to
enforce this at canonicalization]

See also Note [No touchables as FunEq RHS] in TcSMonad; avoiding
double unifications is the main reason we disallow touchable
unification variables as RHS of type family equations: F xis ~ alpha.

Note [The Solver Invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We always add Givens first.  So you might think that the solver has
the invariant

   If the work-item is Given, 
   then the inert item must Given

But this isn't quite true.  Suppose we have, 
    c1: [W] beta ~ [alpha], c2 : [W] blah, c3 :[W] alpha ~ Int
After processing the first two, we get
     c1: [G] beta ~ [alpha], c2 : [W] blah
Now, c3 does not interact with the the given c1, so when we spontaneously
solve c3, we must re-react it with the inert set.  So we can attempt a 
reaction between inert c2 [W] and work-item c3 [G].

It *is* true that [Solver Invariant]
   If the work-item is Given, 
   AND there is a reaction
   then the inert item must Given
or, equivalently,
   If the work-item is Given, 
   and the inert item is Wanted/Derived
   then there is no reaction

Note [Efficient Orientation] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we are interacting two FunEqCans with the same LHS:
          (inert)  ci :: (F ty ~ xi_i) 
          (work)   cw :: (F ty ~ xi_w) 
We prefer to keep the inert (else we pass the work item on down
the pipeline, which is a bit silly).  If we keep the inert, we
will (a) discharge 'cw' 
     (b) produce a new equality work-item (xi_w ~ xi_i)
Notice the orientation (xi_w ~ xi_i) NOT (xi_i ~ xi_w):
    new_work :: xi_w ~ xi_i
    cw := ci ; sym new_work
Why?  Consider the simplest case when xi1 is a type variable.  If
we generate xi1~xi2, porcessing that constraint will kick out 'ci'.
If we generate xi2~xi1, there is less chance of that happening.
Of course it can and should still happen if xi1=a, xi1=Int, say.
But we want to avoid it happening needlessly.

Similarly, if we *can't* keep the inert item (because inert is Wanted,
and work is Given, say), we prefer to orient the new equality (xi_i ~
xi_w).

Note [Carefully solve the right CFunEqCan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the constraints
  c1 :: F Int ~ a      -- Arising from an application line 5
  c2 :: F Int ~ Bool   -- Arising from an application line 10
Suppose that 'a' is a unification variable, arising only from 
flattening.  So there is no error on line 5; it's just a flattening
variable.  But there is (or might be) an error on line 10.

Two ways to combine them, leaving either (Plan A)
  c1 :: F Int ~ a      -- Arising from an application line 5
  c3 :: a ~ Bool       -- Arising from an application line 10
or (Plan B)
  c2 :: F Int ~ Bool   -- Arising from an application line 10
  c4 :: a ~ Bool       -- Arising from an application line 5

Plan A will unify c3, leaving c1 :: F Int ~ Bool as an error
on the *totally innocent* line 5.  An example is test SimpleFail16
where the expected/actual message comes out backwards if we use
the wrong plan.

The second is the right thing to do.  Hence the isMetaTyVarTy
test when solving pairwise CFunEqCan.

Note [Shadowing of Implicit Parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following example:

f :: (?x :: Char) => Char
f = let ?x = 'a' in ?x

The "let ?x = ..." generates an implication constraint of the form:

?x :: Char => ?x :: Char

Furthermore, the signature for `f` also generates an implication
constraint, so we end up with the following nested implication:

?x :: Char => (?x :: Char => ?x :: Char)

Note that the wanted (?x :: Char) constraint may be solved in
two incompatible ways:  either by using the parameter from the
signature, or by using the local definition.  Our intention is
that the local definition should "shadow" the parameter of the
signature, and we implement this as follows: when we add a new
given implicit parameter to the inert set, it replaces any existing
givens for the same implicit parameter.

This works for the normal cases but it has an odd side effect
in some pathological programs like this:

-- This is accepted, the second parameter shadows
f1 :: (?x :: Int, ?x :: Char) => Char
f1 = ?x

-- This is rejected, the second parameter shadows
f2 :: (?x :: Int, ?x :: Char) => Int
f2 = ?x

Both of these are actually wrong:  when we try to use either one,
we'll get two incompatible wnated constraints (?x :: Int, ?x :: Char),
which would lead to an error.

I can think of two ways to fix this:

  1. Simply disallow multiple constratits for the same implicit
    parameter---this is never useful, and it can be detected completely
    syntactically.

  2. Move the shadowing machinery to the location where we nest
     implications, and add some code here that will produce an
     error if we get multiple givens for the same implicit parameter.


Note [Cache-caused loops]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is very dangerous to cache a rewritten wanted family equation as 'solved' in our 
solved cache (which is the default behaviour or xCtFlavor), because the interaction 
may not be contributing towards a solution. Here is an example:

Initial inert set:
  [W] g1 : F a ~ beta1
Work item:
  [W] g2 : F a ~ beta2
The work item will react with the inert yielding the _same_ inert set plus:
    i)   Will set g2 := g1 `cast` g3   
    ii)  Will add to our solved cache that [S] g2 : F a ~ beta2
    iii) Will emit [W] g3 : beta1 ~ beta2 
Now, the g3 work item will be spontaneously solved to [G] g3 : beta1 ~ beta2
and then it will react the item in the inert ([W] g1 : F a ~ beta1). So it 
will set 
      g1 := g ; sym g3 
and what is g? Well it would ideally be a new goal of type (F a ~ beta2) but
remember that we have this in our solved cache, and it is ... g2! In short we 
created the evidence loop:

        g2 := g1 ; g3 
        g3 := refl
        g1 := g2 ; sym g3 

To avoid this situation we do not cache as solved any workitems (or inert) 
which did not really made a 'step' towards proving some goal. Solved's are 
just an optimization so we don't lose anything in terms of completeness of 
solving.

Note [Shadowing of Implicit Parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the following example:

f :: (?x :: Char) => Char
f = let ?x = 'a' in ?x

The "let ?x = ..." generates an implication constraint of the form:

?x :: Char => ?x :: Char


Furthermore, the signature for `f` also generates an implication
constraint, so we end up with the following nested implication:

?x :: Char => (?x :: Char => ?x :: Char)

Note that the wanted (?x :: Char) constraint may be solved in
two incompatible ways:  either by using the parameter from the
signature, or by using the local definition.  Our intention is
that the local definition should "shadow" the parameter of the
signature, and we implement this as follows: when we nest implications,
we remove any implicit parameters in the outer implication, that
have the same name as givens of the inner implication.

Here is another variation of the example:

f :: (?x :: Int) => Char
f = let ?x = 'x' in ?x

This program should also be accepted: the two constraints `?x :: Int`
and `?x :: Char` never exist in the same context, so they don't get to
interact to cause failure.

Note [Superclasses and recursive dictionaries]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Overlaps with Note [SUPERCLASS-LOOP 1]
                  Note [SUPERCLASS-LOOP 2]
                  Note [Recursive instances and superclases]
    ToDo: check overlap and delete redundant stuff

Right before adding a given into the inert set, we must
produce some more work, that will bring the superclasses 
of the given into scope. The superclass constraints go into 
our worklist. 

When we simplify a wanted constraint, if we first see a matching
instance, we may produce new wanted work. To (1) avoid doing this work 
twice in the future and (2) to handle recursive dictionaries we may ``cache'' 
this item as given into our inert set WITHOUT adding its superclass constraints, 
otherwise we'd be in danger of creating a loop [In fact this was the exact reason
for doing the isGoodRecEv check in an older version of the type checker]. 

But now we have added partially solved constraints to the worklist which may 
interact with other wanteds. Consider the example: 

Example 1: 

    class Eq b => Foo a b        --- 0-th selector
    instance Eq a => Foo [a] a   --- fooDFun

and wanted (Foo [t] t). We are first going to see that the instance matches 
and create an inert set that includes the solved (Foo [t] t) but not its superclasses:
       d1 :_g Foo [t] t                 d1 := EvDFunApp fooDFun d3 
Our work list is going to contain a new *wanted* goal
       d3 :_w Eq t 

Ok, so how do we get recursive dictionaries, at all: 

Example 2:

    data D r = ZeroD | SuccD (r (D r));
    
    instance (Eq (r (D r))) => Eq (D r) where
        ZeroD     == ZeroD     = True
        (SuccD a) == (SuccD b) = a == b
        _         == _         = False;
    
    equalDC :: D [] -> D [] -> Bool;
    equalDC = (==);

We need to prove (Eq (D [])). Here's how we go:

	d1 :_w Eq (D [])

by instance decl, holds if
	d2 :_w Eq [D []]
	where 	d1 = dfEqD d2

*BUT* we have an inert set which gives us (no superclasses): 
        d1 :_g Eq (D []) 
By the instance declaration of Eq we can show the 'd2' goal if 
	d3 :_w Eq (D [])
	where	d2 = dfEqList d3
		d1 = dfEqD d2
Now, however this wanted can interact with our inert d1 to set: 
        d3 := d1 
and solve the goal. Why was this interaction OK? Because, if we chase the 
evidence of d1 ~~> dfEqD d2 ~~-> dfEqList d3, so by setting d3 := d1 we 
are really setting
        d3 := dfEqD2 (dfEqList d3) 
which is FINE because the use of d3 is protected by the instance function 
applications. 

So, our strategy is to try to put solved wanted dictionaries into the
inert set along with their superclasses (when this is meaningful,
i.e. when new wanted goals are generated) but solve a wanted dictionary
from a given only in the case where the evidence variable of the
wanted is mentioned in the evidence of the given (recursively through
the evidence binds) in a protected way: more instance function applications 
than superclass selectors.

Here are some more examples from GHC's previous type checker


Example 3: 
This code arises in the context of "Scrap Your Boilerplate with Class"

    class Sat a
    class Data ctx a
    instance  Sat (ctx Char)             => Data ctx Char       -- dfunData1
    instance (Sat (ctx [a]), Data ctx a) => Data ctx [a]        -- dfunData2

    class Data Maybe a => Foo a    

    instance Foo t => Sat (Maybe t)                             -- dfunSat

    instance Data Maybe a => Foo a                              -- dfunFoo1
    instance Foo a        => Foo [a]                            -- dfunFoo2
    instance                 Foo [Char]                         -- dfunFoo3

Consider generating the superclasses of the instance declaration
	 instance Foo a => Foo [a]

So our problem is this
    d0 :_g Foo t
    d1 :_w Data Maybe [t] 

We may add the given in the inert set, along with its superclasses
[assuming we don't fail because there is a matching instance, see 
 topReactionsStage, given case ]
  Inert:
    d0 :_g Foo t 
  WorkList 
    d01 :_g Data Maybe t  -- d2 := EvDictSuperClass d0 0 
    d1 :_w Data Maybe [t] 
Then d2 can readily enter the inert, and we also do solving of the wanted
  Inert: 
    d0 :_g Foo t 
    d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
  WorkList
    d2 :_w Sat (Maybe [t])          
    d3 :_w Data Maybe t
    d01 :_g Data Maybe t 
Now, we may simplify d2 more: 
  Inert:
      d0 :_g Foo t 
      d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
      d1 :_g Data Maybe [t] 
      d2 :_g Sat (Maybe [t])          d2 := dfunSat d4 
  WorkList: 
      d3 :_w Data Maybe t 
      d4 :_w Foo [t] 
      d01 :_g Data Maybe t 

Now, we can just solve d3.
  Inert
      d0 :_g Foo t 
      d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
      d2 :_g Sat (Maybe [t])          d2 := dfunSat d4 
  WorkList
      d4 :_w Foo [t] 
      d01 :_g Data Maybe t 
And now we can simplify d4 again, but since it has superclasses we *add* them to the worklist:
  Inert
      d0 :_g Foo t 
      d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
      d2 :_g Sat (Maybe [t])          d2 := dfunSat d4 
      d4 :_g Foo [t]                  d4 := dfunFoo2 d5 
  WorkList:
      d5 :_w Foo t 
      d6 :_g Data Maybe [t]           d6 := EvDictSuperClass d4 0
      d01 :_g Data Maybe t 
Now, d5 can be solved! (and its superclass enter scope) 
  Inert
      d0 :_g Foo t 
      d1 :_s Data Maybe [t]           d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3 
      d2 :_g Sat (Maybe [t])          d2 := dfunSat d4 
      d4 :_g Foo [t]                  d4 := dfunFoo2 d5 
      d5 :_g Foo t                    d5 := dfunFoo1 d7
  WorkList:
      d7 :_w Data Maybe t
      d6 :_g Data Maybe [t]
      d8 :_g Data Maybe t            d8 := EvDictSuperClass d5 0
      d01 :_g Data Maybe t 

Now, two problems: 
   [1] Suppose we pick d8 and we react him with d01. Which of the two givens should 
       we keep? Well, we *MUST NOT* drop d01 because d8 contains recursive evidence 
       that must not be used (look at case interactInert where both inert and workitem
       are givens). So we have several options: 
       - Drop the workitem always (this will drop d8)
              This feels very unsafe -- what if the work item was the "good" one
              that should be used later to solve another wanted?
       - Don't drop anyone: the inert set may contain multiple givens! 
              [This is currently implemented] 

The "don't drop anyone" seems the most safe thing to do, so now we come to problem 2: 
  [2] We have added both d6 and d01 in the inert set, and we are interacting our wanted
      d7. Now the [isRecDictEv] function in the ineration solver 
      [case inert-given workitem-wanted] will prevent us from interacting d7 := d8 
      precisely because chasing the evidence of d8 leads us to an unguarded use of d7. 

      So, no interaction happens there. Then we meet d01 and there is no recursion 
      problem there [isRectDictEv] gives us the OK to interact and we do solve d7 := d01! 
             
Note [SUPERCLASS-LOOP 1]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have to be very, very careful when generating superclasses, lest we
accidentally build a loop. Here's an example:

  class S a

  class S a => C a where { opc :: a -> a }
  class S b => D b where { opd :: b -> b }
  
  instance C Int where
     opc = opd
  
  instance D Int where
     opd = opc

From (instance C Int) we get the constraint set {ds1:S Int, dd:D Int}
Simplifying, we may well get:
	$dfCInt = :C ds1 (opd dd)
	dd  = $dfDInt
	ds1 = $p1 dd
Notice that we spot that we can extract ds1 from dd.  

Alas!  Alack! We can do the same for (instance D Int):

	$dfDInt = :D ds2 (opc dc)
	dc  = $dfCInt
	ds2 = $p1 dc

And now we've defined the superclass in terms of itself.
Two more nasty cases are in
	tcrun021
	tcrun033

Solution: 
  - Satisfy the superclass context *all by itself* 
    (tcSimplifySuperClasses)
  - And do so completely; i.e. no left-over constraints
    to mix with the constraints arising from method declarations


Note [SUPERCLASS-LOOP 2]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to be careful when adding "the constaint we are trying to prove".
Suppose we are *given* d1:Ord a, and want to deduce (d2:C [a]) where

	class Ord a => C a where
	instance Ord [a] => C [a] where ...

Then we'll use the instance decl to deduce C [a] from Ord [a], and then add the
superclasses of C [a] to avails.  But we must not overwrite the binding
for Ord [a] (which is obtained from Ord a) with a superclass selection or we'll just
build a loop! 

Here's another variant, immortalised in tcrun020
	class Monad m => C1 m
	class C1 m => C2 m x
	instance C2 Maybe Bool
For the instance decl we need to build (C1 Maybe), and it's no good if
we run around and add (C2 Maybe Bool) and its superclasses to the avails 
before we search for C1 Maybe.

Here's another example 
 	class Eq b => Foo a b
	instance Eq a => Foo [a] a
If we are reducing
	(Foo [t] t)

we'll first deduce that it holds (via the instance decl).  We must not
then overwrite the Eq t constraint with a superclass selection!

At first I had a gross hack, whereby I simply did not add superclass constraints
in addWanted, though I did for addGiven and addIrred.  This was sub-optimal,
becuase it lost legitimate superclass sharing, and it still didn't do the job:
I found a very obscure program (now tcrun021) in which improvement meant the
simplifier got two bites a the cherry... so something seemed to be an Stop
first time, but reducible next time.

Now we implement the Right Solution, which is to check for loops directly 
when adding superclasses.  It's a bit like the occurs check in unification.

Note [Recursive instances and superclases]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this code, which arises in the context of "Scrap Your 
Boilerplate with Class".  

    class Sat a
    class Data ctx a
    instance  Sat (ctx Char)             => Data ctx Char
    instance (Sat (ctx [a]), Data ctx a) => Data ctx [a]

    class Data Maybe a => Foo a

    instance Foo t => Sat (Maybe t)

    instance Data Maybe a => Foo a
    instance Foo a        => Foo [a]
    instance                 Foo [Char]

In the instance for Foo [a], when generating evidence for the superclasses
(ie in tcSimplifySuperClasses) we need a superclass (Data Maybe [a]).
Using the instance for Data, we therefore need
        (Sat (Maybe [a], Data Maybe a)
But we are given (Foo a), and hence its superclass (Data Maybe a).
So that leaves (Sat (Maybe [a])).  Using the instance for Sat means
we need (Foo [a]).  And that is the very dictionary we are bulding
an instance for!  So we must put that in the "givens".  So in this
case we have
	Given:  Foo a, Foo [a]
	Wanted: Data Maybe [a]

BUT we must *not not not* put the *superclasses* of (Foo [a]) in
the givens, which is what 'addGiven' would normally do. Why? Because
(Data Maybe [a]) is the superclass, so we'd "satisfy" the wanted 
by selecting a superclass from Foo [a], which simply makes a loop.

On the other hand we *must* put the superclasses of (Foo a) in
the givens, as you can see from the derivation described above.

Conclusion: in the very special case of tcSimplifySuperClasses
we have one 'given' (namely the "this" dictionary) whose superclasses
must not be added to 'givens' by addGiven.  

There is a complication though.  Suppose there are equalities
      instance (Eq a, a~b) => Num (a,b)
Then we normalise the 'givens' wrt the equalities, so the original
given "this" dictionary is cast to one of a different type.  So it's a
bit trickier than before to identify the "special" dictionary whose
superclasses must not be added. See test
   indexed-types/should_run/EqInInstance

We need a persistent property of the dictionary to record this
special-ness.  Current I'm using the InstLocOrigin (a bit of a hack,
but cool), which is maintained by dictionary normalisation.
Specifically, the InstLocOrigin is
	     NoScOrigin
then the no-superclass thing kicks in.  WATCH OUT if you fiddle
with InstLocOrigin!

Note [MATCHING-SYNONYMS]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When trying to match a dictionary (D tau) to a top-level instance, or a 
type family equation (F taus_1 ~ tau_2) to a top-level family instance, 
we do *not* need to expand type synonyms because the matcher will do that for us.


Note [RHS-FAMILY-SYNONYMS] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The RHS of a family instance is represented as yet another constructor which is 
like a type synonym for the real RHS the programmer declared. Eg: 
    type instance F (a,a) = [a] 
Becomes: 
    :R32 a = [a]      -- internal type synonym introduced
    F (a,a) ~ :R32 a  -- instance 

When we react a family instance with a type family equation in the work list 
we keep the synonym-using RHS without expansion.

%************************************************************************

When we spot an equality arising from a functional dependency,
we now use that equality (a "wanted") to rewrite the work-item
constraint right away.  This avoids two dangers

 Danger 1: If we send the original constraint on down the pipeline
           it may react with an instance declaration, and in delicate
	   situations (when a Given overlaps with an instance) that
	   may produce new insoluble goals: see Trac #4952

 Danger 2: If we don't rewrite the constraint, it may re-react
           with the same thing later, and produce the same equality
           again --> termination worries.

To achieve this required some refactoring of FunDeps.lhs (nicer
now!).  

\begin{code}

Note [FunDep and implicit parameter reactions] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, our story of interacting two dictionaries (or a dictionary
and top-level instances) for functional dependencies, and implicit
paramters, is that we simply produce new Derived equalities.  So for example

        class D a b | a -> b where ... 
    Inert: 
        d1 :g D Int Bool
    WorkItem: 
        d2 :w D Int alpha

    We generate the extra work item
        cv :d alpha ~ Bool
    where 'cv' is currently unused.  However, this new item can perhaps be 
    spontaneously solved to become given and react with d2,
    discharging it in favour of a new constraint d2' thus:
        d2' :w D Int Bool
	d2 := d2' |> D Int cv
    Now d2' can be discharged from d1

We could be more aggressive and try to *immediately* solve the dictionary 
using those extra equalities, but that requires those equalities to carry 
evidence and derived do not carry evidence.

If that were the case with the same inert set and work item we might dischard 
d2 directly:

        cv :w alpha ~ Bool
        d2 := d1 |> D Int cv

But in general it's a bit painful to figure out the necessary coercion,
so we just take the first approach. Here is a better example. Consider:
    class C a b c | a -> b 
And: 
     [Given]  d1 : C T Int Char 
     [Wanted] d2 : C T beta Int 
In this case, it's *not even possible* to solve the wanted immediately. 
So we should simply output the functional dependency and add this guy
[but NOT its superclasses] back in the worklist. Even worse: 
     [Given] d1 : C T Int beta 
     [Wanted] d2: C T beta Int 
Then it is solvable, but its very hard to detect this on the spot. 

It's exactly the same with implicit parameters, except that the
"aggressive" approach would be much easier to implement.

Note [When improvement happens]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We fire an improvement rule when

  * Two constraints match (modulo the fundep)
      e.g. C t1 t2, C t1 t3    where C a b | a->b
    The two match because the first arg is identical
   
Note that we *do* fire the improvement if one is Given and one is Derived (e.g. a 
superclass of a Wanted goal) or if both are Given.

Example (tcfail138)
    class L a b | a -> b
    class (G a, L a b) => C a b

    instance C a b' => G (Maybe a)
    instance C a b  => C (Maybe a) a
    instance L (Maybe a) a

When solving the superclasses of the (C (Maybe a) a) instance, we get
  Given:  C a b  ... and hance by superclasses, (G a, L a b)
  Wanted: G (Maybe a)
Use the instance decl to get
  Wanted: C a b'
The (C a b') is inert, so we generate its Derived superclasses (L a b'),
and now we need improvement between that derived superclass an the Given (L a b)

Test typecheck/should_fail/FDsFromGivens also shows why it's a good idea to 
emit Derived FDs for givens as well. 

Note [Overriding implicit parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   f :: (?x::a) -> Bool -> a
  
   g v = let ?x::Int = 3 
         in (f v, let ?x::Bool = True in f v)

This should probably be well typed, with
   g :: Bool -> (Int, Bool)

So the inner binding for ?x::Bool *overrides* the outer one.
Hence a work-item Given overrides an inert-item Given.

Note [Given constraint that matches an instance declaration]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What should we do when we discover that one (or more) top-level 
instances match a given (or solved) class constraint? We have 
two possibilities:

  1. Reject the program. The reason is that there may not be a unique
     best strategy for the solver. Example, from the OutsideIn(X) paper:
       instance P x => Q [x] 
       instance (x ~ y) => R [x] y 
     
       wob :: forall a b. (Q [b], R b a) => a -> Int 

       g :: forall a. Q [a] => [a] -> Int 
       g x = wob x 

       will generate the impliation constraint: 
            Q [a] => (Q [beta], R beta [a]) 
       If we react (Q [beta]) with its top-level axiom, we end up with a 
       (P beta), which we have no way of discharging. On the other hand, 
       if we react R beta [a] with the top-level we get  (beta ~ a), which 
       is solvable and can help us rewrite (Q [beta]) to (Q [a]) which is 
       now solvable by the given Q [a]. 
 
     However, this option is restrictive, for instance [Example 3] from 
     Note [Recursive instances and superclases] will fail to work. 

  2. Ignore the problem, hoping that the situations where there exist indeed
     such multiple strategies are rare: Indeed the cause of the previous 
     problem is that (R [x] y) yields the new work (x ~ y) which can be 
     *spontaneously* solved, not using the givens. 

We are choosing option 2 below but we might consider having a flag as well.


Note [New Wanted Superclass Work] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Even in the case of wanted constraints, we may add some superclasses 
as new given work. The reason is: 

        To allow FD-like improvement for type families. Assume that 
        we have a class 
             class C a b | a -> b 
        and we have to solve the implication constraint: 
             C a b => C a beta 
        Then, FD improvement can help us to produce a new wanted (beta ~ b) 

        We want to have the same effect with the type family encoding of 
        functional dependencies. Namely, consider: 
             class (F a ~ b) => C a b 
        Now suppose that we have: 
               given: C a b 
               wanted: C a beta 
        By interacting the given we will get given (F a ~ b) which is not 
        enough by itself to make us discharge (C a beta). However, we 
        may create a new derived equality from the super-class of the
        wanted constraint (C a beta), namely derived (F a ~ beta). 
        Now we may interact this with given (F a ~ b) to get: 
                  derived :  beta ~ b 
        But 'beta' is a touchable unification variable, and hence OK to 
        unify it with 'b', replacing the derived evidence with the identity. 

        This requires trySpontaneousSolve to solve *derived*
        equalities that have a touchable in their RHS, *in addition*
        to solving wanted equalities.

We also need to somehow use the superclasses to quantify over a minimal, 
constraint see note [Minimize by Superclasses] in TcSimplify.


Finally, here is another example where this is useful. 

Example 1:
----------
   class (F a ~ b) => C a b 
And we are given the wanteds:
      w1 : C a b 
      w2 : C a c 
      w3 : b ~ c 
We surely do *not* want to quantify over (b ~ c), since if someone provides
dictionaries for (C a b) and (C a c), these dictionaries can provide a proof 
of (b ~ c), hence no extra evidence is necessary. Here is what will happen: 

     Step 1: We will get new *given* superclass work, 
             provisionally to our solving of w1 and w2
             
               g1: F a ~ b, g2 : F a ~ c, 
               w1 : C a b, w2 : C a c, w3 : b ~ c

             The evidence for g1 and g2 is a superclass evidence term: 

               g1 := sc w1, g2 := sc w2

     Step 2: The givens will solve the wanted w3, so that 
               w3 := sym (sc w1) ; sc w2 
                  
     Step 3: Now, one may naively assume that then w2 can be solve from w1
             after rewriting with the (now solved equality) (b ~ c). 
             
             But this rewriting is ruled out by the isGoodRectDict! 

Conclusion, we will (correctly) end up with the unsolved goals 
    (C a b, C a c)   

NB: The desugarer needs be more clever to deal with equalities 
    that participate in recursive dictionary bindings.

Note [Instance and Given overlap]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assume that we have an inert set that looks as follows:
       [Given] D [Int]
And an instance declaration: 
       instance C a => D [a]
A new wanted comes along of the form: 
       [Wanted] D [alpha]

One possibility is to apply the instance declaration which will leave us 
with an unsolvable goal (C alpha). However, later on a new constraint may 
arise (for instance due to a functional dependency between two later dictionaries), 
that will add the equality (alpha ~ Int), in which case our ([Wanted] D [alpha]) 
will be transformed to [Wanted] D [Int], which could have been discharged by the given. 

The solution is that in matchClassInst and eventually in topReact, we get back with 
a matching instance, only when there is no Given in the inerts which is unifiable to
this particular dictionary.

The end effect is that, much as we do for overlapping instances, we delay choosing a 
class instance if there is a possibility of another instance OR a given to match our 
constraint later on. This fixes bugs #4981 and #5002.

This is arguably not easy to appear in practice due to our aggressive prioritization 
of equality solving over other constraints, but it is possible. I've added a test case 
in typecheck/should-compile/GivenOverlapping.hs

We ignore the overlap problem if -XIncoherentInstances is in force: see
Trac #6002 for a worked-out example where this makes a difference.

Moreover notice that our goals here are different than the goals of the top-level 
overlapping checks. There we are interested in validating the following principle:
 
    If we inline a function f at a site where the same global instance environment
