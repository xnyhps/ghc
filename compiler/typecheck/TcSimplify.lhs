Note [Top-level Defaulting Plan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have considered two design choices for where/when to apply defaulting.   
   (i) Do it in SimplCheck mode only /whenever/ you try to solve some 
       flat constraints, maybe deep inside the context of implications.
       This used to be the case in GHC 7.4.1.
   (ii) Do it in a tight loop at simplifyTop, once all other constraint has 
        finished. This is the current story.

Option (i) had many disadvantages: 
   a) First it was deep inside the actual solver, 
   b) Second it was dependent on the context (Infer a type signature, 
      or Check a type signature, or Interactive) since we did not want 
      to always start defaulting when inferring (though there is an exception to  
      this see Note [Default while Inferring])
   c) It plainly did not work. Consider typecheck/should_compile/DfltProb2.hs:
          f :: Int -> Bool
          f x = const True (\y -> let w :: a -> a
                                      w a = const a (y+1)
                                  in w y)
      We will get an implication constraint (for beta the type of y):
               [untch=beta] forall a. 0 => Num beta
      which we really cannot default /while solving/ the implication, since beta is
      untouchable.

Instead our new defaulting story is to pull defaulting out of the solver loop and
go with option (i), implemented at SimplifyTop. Namely:
     - First have a go at solving the residual constraint of the whole program
     - Try to approximate it with a flat constraint
     - Figure out derived defaulting equations for that flat constraint
     - Go round the loop again if you did manage to get some equations

Now, that has to do with class defaulting. However there exists type variable /kind/
defaulting. Again this is done at the top-level and the plan is:
     - At the top-level, once you had a go at solving the constraint, do 
       figure out /all/ the touchable unification variables of the wanted contraints.
     - Apply defaulting to their kinds

More details in Note [DefaultTyVar].

Note [Which variables to quantify]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose the inferred type of a function is
   T kappa (alpha:kappa) -> Int
where alpha is a type unification variable and 
      kappa is a kind unification variable
Then we want to quantify over *both* alpha and kappa.  But notice that
kappa appears "at top level" of the type, as well as inside the kind
of alpha.  So it should be fine to just look for the "top level"
kind/type variables of the type, without looking transitively into the
kinds of those type variables.

Note [Quantification with errors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we find that the RHS of the definition has some absolutely-insoluble
constraints, we abandon all attempts to find a context to quantify
over, and instead make the function fully-polymorphic in whatever
type we have found.  For two reasons
  a) Minimise downstream errors
  b) Avoid spurious errors from this function
   

Note [Default while Inferring]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our current plan is that defaulting only happens at simplifyTop and
not simplifyInfer.  This may lead to some insoluble deferred constraints
Example:

instance D g => C g Int b 

constraint inferred = (forall b. 0 => C gamma alpha b) /\ Num alpha
type inferred       = gamma -> gamma 

Now, if we try to default (alpha := Int) we will be able to refine the implication to 
  (forall b. 0 => C gamma Int b) 
which can then be simplified further to 
  (forall b. 0 => D gamma)
Finally we /can/ approximate this implication with (D gamma) and infer the quantified
type:  forall g. D g => g -> g

Instead what will currently happen is that we will get a quantified type 
(forall g. g -> g) and an implication:
       forall g. 0 => (forall b. 0 => C g alpha b) /\ Num alpha

which, even if the simplifyTop defaults (alpha := Int) we will still be left with an 
unsolvable implication:
       forall g. 0 => (forall b. 0 => D g)

The concrete example would be: 
       h :: C g a s => g -> a -> ST s a
       f (x::gamma) = (\_ -> x) (runST (h x (undefined::alpha)) + 1)

But it is quite tedious to do defaulting and resolve the implication constraints and
we have not observed code breaking because of the lack of defaulting in inference so 
we don't do it for now.



Note [Minimize by Superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
When we quantify over a constraint, in simplifyInfer we need to
quantify over a constraint that is minimal in some sense: For
instance, if the final wanted constraint is (Eq alpha, Ord alpha),
we'd like to quantify over Ord alpha, because we can just get Eq alpha
from superclass selection from Ord alpha. This minimization is what
mkMinimalBySCs does. Then, simplifyInfer uses the minimal constraint
to check the original wanted.


Note [Avoid unecessary constraint simplification]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    -------- NB NB NB (Jun 12) ------------- 
    This note not longer applies; see the notes with Trac #4361.
    But I'm leaving it in here so we remember the issue.)
    ----------------------------------------
When inferring the type of a let-binding, with simplifyInfer,
try to avoid unnecessarily simplifying class constraints.
Doing so aids sharing, but it also helps with delicate 
situations like

   instance C t => C [t] where ..

   f :: C [t] => ....
   f x = let g y = ...(constraint C [t])... 
         in ...
When inferring a type for 'g', we don't want to apply the
instance decl, because then we can't satisfy (C t).  So we
just notice that g isn't quantified over 't' and partition
the contraints before simplifying.

Note [RULE quanfification over equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Decideing which equalities to quantify over is tricky:
 * We do not want to quantify over insoluble equalities (Int ~ Bool)
    (a) because we prefer to report a LHS type error
    (b) because if such things end up in 'givens' we get a bogus
        "inaccessible code" error

 * But we do want to quantify over things like (a ~ F b), where
   F is a type function.

The difficulty is that it's hard to tell what is insoluble!
So we see whether the simplificaiotn step yielded any type errors,
and if so refrain from quantifying over *any* equalites.

Note [Deferring coercion errors to runtime]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While developing, sometimes it is desirable to allow compilation to succeed even
if there are type errors in the code. Consider the following case:

  module Main where

  a :: Int
  a = 'a'

  main = print "b"

Even though `a` is ill-typed, it is not used in the end, so if all that we're
interested in is `main` it is handy to be able to ignore the problems in `a`.

Since we treat type equalities as evidence, this is relatively simple. Whenever
we run into a type mismatch in TcUnify, we normally just emit an error. But it
is always safe to defer the mismatch to the main constraint solver. If we do
that, `a` will get transformed into

  co :: Int ~ Char
  co = ...

  a :: Int
  a = 'a' `cast` co

The constraint solver would realize that `co` is an insoluble constraint, and
emit an error with `reportUnsolved`. But we can also replace the right-hand side
of `co` with `error "Deferred type error: Int ~ Char"`. This allows the program
to compile, and it will run fine unless we evaluate `a`. This is what
`deferErrorsToRuntime` does.

It does this by keeping track of which errors correspond to which coercion
in TcErrors (with ErrEnv). TcErrors.reportTidyWanteds does not print the errors
and does not fail if -fwarn-type-errors is on, so that we can continue
compilation. The errors are turned into warnings in `reportUnsolved`.

Note [Zonk after solving]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We zonk the result immediately after constraint solving, for two reasons:

a) because zonkWC generates evidence, and this is the moment when we
   have a suitable evidence variable to hand.

Note that *after* solving the constraints are typically small, so the
overhead is not great.

Note [ApproximateWC]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
approximateWC takes a constraint, typically arising from the RHS of a
let-binding whose type we are *inferring*, and extracts from it some
*flat* constraints that we might plausibly abstract over.  Of course
the top-level flat constraints are plausible, but we also float constraints
out from inside, if the are not captured by skolems.

However we do *not* float anything out if the implication binds equality
constriants, because that defeats the OutsideIn story.  Consider
   data T a where
     TInt :: T Int
     MkT :: T a

   f TInt = 3::Int

We get the implication (a ~ Int => res ~ Int), where so far we've decided 
  f :: T a -> res
We don't want to float (res~Int) out because then we'll infer  
  f :: T a -> Int
which is only on of the possible types. (GHC 7.6 accidentally *did*
float out of such implications, which meant it would happily infer
non-principal types.)

Note [DefaultTyVar]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
defaultTyVar is used on any un-instantiated meta type variables to
default the kind of OpenKind and ArgKind etc to *.  This is important 
to ensure that instance declarations match.  For example consider

     instance Show (a->b)
     foo x = show (\_ -> True)

Then we'll get a constraint (Show (p ->q)) where p has kind ArgKind,
and that won't match the typeKind (*) in the instance decl.  See tests
tc217 and tc175.

We look only at touchable type variables. No further constraints
are going to affect these type variables, so it's time to do it by
hand.  However we aren't ready to default them fully to () or
whatever, because the type-class defaulting rules have yet to run.

An important point is that if the type variable tv has kind k and the
default is default_k we do not simply generate [D] (k ~ default_k) because:

   (1) k may be ArgKind and default_k may be * so we will fail

   (2) We need to rewrite all occurrences of the tv to be a type
       variable with the right kind and we choose to do this by rewriting 
       the type variable /itself/ by a new variable which does have the 
       right kind.

Note [Promote _and_ default when inferring]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we are inferring a type, we simplify the constraint, and then use
approximateWC to produce a list of candidate constraints.  Then we MUST

  a) Promote any meta-tyvars that have been floated out by 
     approximateWC, to restore invariant (MetaTvInv) described in 
     Note [Untouchable type variables] in TcType.

  b) Default the kind of any meta-tyyvars that are not mentioned in
     in the environment.

To see (b), suppose the constraint is (C ((a :: OpenKind) -> Int)), and we
have an instance (C ((x:*) -> Int)).  The instance doesn't match -- but it
should!  If we don't solve the constraint, we'll stupidly quantify over 
(C (a->Int)) and, worse, in doing so zonkQuantifiedTyVar will quantify over
(b:*) instead of (a:OpenKind), which can lead to disaster; see Trac #7332.

Note [Float Equalities out of Implications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
For ordinary pattern matches (including existentials) we float 
equalities out of implications, for instance: 
     data T where 
       MkT :: Eq a => a -> T 
     f x y = case x of MkT _ -> (y::Int)
We get the implication constraint (x::T) (y::alpha): 
     forall a. [untouchable=alpha] Eq a => alpha ~ Int
We want to float out the equality into a scope where alpha is no
longer untouchable, to solve the implication!  

But we cannot float equalities out of implications whose givens may
yield or contain equalities:

      data T a where 
        T1 :: T Int
        T2 :: T Bool
        T3 :: T a 
        
      h :: T a -> a -> Int
      
      f x y = case x of 
                T1 -> y::Int
                T2 -> y::Bool
                T3 -> h x y

We generate constraint, for (x::T alpha) and (y :: beta): 
   [untouchables = beta] (alpha ~ Int => beta ~ Int)   -- From 1st branch
   [untouchables = beta] (alpha ~ Bool => beta ~ Bool) -- From 2nd branch
   (alpha ~ beta)                                      -- From 3rd branch 

If we float the equality (beta ~ Int) outside of the first implication and 
the equality (beta ~ Bool) out of the second we get an insoluble constraint.
But if we just leave them inside the implications we unify alpha := beta and
solve everything.

Principle: 
    We do not want to float equalities out which may need the given *evidence*
    to become soluble.

Consequence: classes with functional dependencies don't matter (since there is 
no evidence for a fundep equality), but equality superclasses do matter (since 
they carry evidence).

Note [Promoting unification variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we float an equality out of an implication we must "promote" free
unification variables of the equality, in order to maintain Invariant
(MetaTvInv) from Note [Untouchable type variables] in TcType.  for the
leftover implication.

This is absolutely necessary. Consider the following example. We start
with two implications and a class with a functional dependency.

    class C x y | x -> y
    instance C [a] [a]
          
    (I1)      [untch=beta]forall b. 0 => F Int ~ [beta]
    (I2)      [untch=beta]forall c. 0 => F Int ~ [[alpha]] /\ C beta [c]

We float (F Int ~ [beta]) out of I1, and we float (F Int ~ [[alpha]]) out of I2. 
They may react to yield that (beta := [alpha]) which can then be pushed inwards 
the leftover of I2 to get (C [alpha] [a]) which, using the FunDep, will mean that
(alpha := a). In the end we will have the skolem 'b' escaping in the untouchable
beta! Concrete example is in indexed_types/should_fail/ExtraTcsUntch.hs:

    class C x y | x -> y where 
     op :: x -> y -> ()

    instance C [a] [a]

    type family F a :: *

    h :: F Int -> ()
    h = undefined

    data TEx where 
      TEx :: a -> TEx 


    f (x::beta) = 
        let g1 :: forall b. b -> ()
            g1 _ = h [x]
            g2 z = case z of TEx y -> (h [[undefined]], op x [y])
        in (g1 '3', g2 undefined)



Note [Solving Family Equations] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
After we are done with simplification we may be left with constraints of the form:
     [Wanted] F xis ~ beta 
If 'beta' is a touchable unification variable not already bound in the TyBinds 
then we'd like to create a binding for it, effectively "defaulting" it to be 'F xis'.

When is it ok to do so? 
    1) 'beta' must not already be defaulted to something. Example: 

           [Wanted] F Int  ~ beta   <~ Will default [beta := F Int]
           [Wanted] F Char ~ beta   <~ Already defaulted, can't default again. We 
                                       have to report this as unsolved.

    2) However, we must still do an occurs check when defaulting (F xis ~ beta), to 
       set [beta := F xis] only if beta is not among the free variables of xis.

    3) Notice that 'beta' can't be bound in ty binds already because we rewrite RHS 
       of type family equations. See Inert Set invariants in TcInteract.

This solving is now happening during zonking, see Note [Unflattening while zonking]
in TcMType.

Note [Avoiding spurious errors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When doing the unification for defaulting, we check for skolem
type variables, and simply don't default them.  For example:
   f = (*)	-- Monomorphic
   g :: Num a => a -> a
   g x = f x x
Here, we get a complaint when checking the type signature for g,
that g isn't polymorphic enough; but then we get another one when
dealing with the (Num a) context arising from f's definition;
we try to unify a with Int (to default it), but find that it's
already been unified with the rigid variable from g's type sig
