# Despite the name "package", this file contains the master list of
# the *repositories* that make up GHC. It is parsed by
# * boot
# * sync-all
# * rules/extra-packages.mk
#
# Some of this information is duplicated elsewhere in the build system:
#    See Trac #3896
# In particular when adding libraries to this file, you also need to add
# the library to the SUBDIRS variable in libraries/Makefile so that they
# actually get built
#
# The repos are of several kinds:
#    - The main GHC source repo
#    - Each boot package lives in a repo
#    - DPH is a repo that contains several packages
#    - Haddock and hsc2hs are applications, built on top of GHC,
#        and in turn needed to bootstrap GHC
#    - ghc-tarballs is need to build GHC
#    - nofib and testsuite are optional helpers
#
# The format of the lines in this file is:
#   localpath    tag    remotepath
# where
#   * 'localpath' is where to put the repository in a checked out tree.
#   * 'remotepath' is where the repository is in the central repository.
#     It is - for submodules.
#
#   * The 'tag' determines when "darcs-all get" will get the
#     repo. If the tag is "-" then it will always get it, but if there
#     is a tag then a corresponding flag must be given to darcs-all, e.g.
#     if you want to get the packages with an "extralibs" or "testsuite"
#     tag then you need to use "darcs-all --extra --testsuite get".
#     Support for new tags must be manually added to the darcs-all script.
#
#     'tag' is also used to determine which packages the build system
#     deems to have the EXTRA_PACKAGE property: tags 'dph' and 'extra'
#     both give this property
#
# Lines that start with a '#' are comments.
