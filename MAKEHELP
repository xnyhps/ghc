Using the GHC build system
--------------------------

For a "Getting Started" guide, see:

  http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/Hacking

Common commands:

  make

     Builds everything: ghc stages 1 and 2, all libraries and tools.

  make -j2

     Parallel build: runs up to 2 commands at a time (use the number of
     CPUs in your machine in place of '2')

  cd <dir>; make

     Builds everything in the given directory.

  cd <dir>; make help

     Shows the targets available in <dir>

  make install

     Installs GHC, libraries and tools under $(prefix)

  make sdist
  make binary-dist

     Builds a source or binary distribution respectively

  make show VALUE=<var>

     Displays the value of make variable <var>

  make clean
  make distclean
  make maintainer-clean

     Various levels of cleaning: "clean" restores the tree to the
     state after "./configure", "distclean" restores to the state
     after "perl boot", and maintainer-clean restores the tree to the
     completely clean checked-out state.
