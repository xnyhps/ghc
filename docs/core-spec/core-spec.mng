\section{Introduction}

There are a number of details elided from this presentation. The goal of the
formalism is to aid in reasoning about type safety, and checks that do not
work toward this goal were omitted. For example, various scoping checks (other
than basic context inclusion) appear in the GHC code but not here.

\section{Grammar}

\subsection{Metavariables}

We will use the following metavariables:

\ottmetavars{}\\

\subsection{Literals}

Literals do not play a major role, so we leave them abstract:

\gram{\ottlit}

We also leave abstract the function \coderef{basicTypes/Literal.lhs}{literalType}
and the judgment \coderef{coreSyn/CoreLint.lhs}{lintTyLit} (written $[[G |-tylit lit : k]]$).

\subsection{Variables}

GHC uses the same datatype to represent term-level variables and type-level
variables:

\gram{
\ottz
}
foo

\gram{
\ottn
}

\subsection{Expressions}

The datatype that represents expressions:

\gram{\otte}

There are a few key invariants about expressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The right-hand sides of all top-level and recursive $[[let]]$s
must be of lifted type.
\item The right-hand side of a non-recursive $[[let]]$ and the argument
of an application may be of unlifted type, but only if the expression
is ok-for-speculation. See \verb|#let_app_invariant#| in \ghcfile{coreSyn/CoreSyn.lhs}.
\item We allow a non-recursive $[[let]]$ for bind a type variable.
\item The $[[_]]$ case for a $[[case]]$ must come first.
\item The list of case alternatives must be exhaustive.
\item Types and coercions can only appear on the right-hand-side of an application.
\end{itemize}

Bindings for $[[let]]$ statements:

\gram{\ottbinding}

Case alternatives:

\gram{\ottalt}

Constructors as used in patterns:

\gram{\ottKp}

Notes that can be inserted into the AST. We leave these abstract:

\gram{\otttick}

A program is just a list of bindings:

\gram{\ottprogram}

\subsection{Types}

\gram{\ottt}

There are some invariants on types:
\begin{itemize}
\item The type $[[t1]]$ in the form $[[t1 t2]]$ must not be a type constructor
$[[T]]$. It should be another application or a type variable.
\item The form $[[T </ ti // i /> ]]$ (\texttt{TyConApp}) 
does \emph{not} need to be saturated.
\item A saturated application of $[[(->) t1 t2]]$ should be represented as 
$[[t1 -> t2]]$. This is a different point in the grammar, not just pretty-printing.
The constructor for a saturated $[[(->)]]$ is \texttt{FunTy}.
\item A type-level literal is represented in GHC with a different datatype than
a term-level literal, but we are ignoring this distinction here.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coercions}

\gram{\ottg}

Invariants on coercions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $[[<t1 t2>]]$ is used; never $[[<t1> <t2>]]$.
\item If $[[<T>]]$ is applied to some coercions, at least one of which is not
reflexive, use $[[T </ gi // i />]]$, never $[[<T> g1 g2]] \ldots$.
\item The $[[T]]$ in $[[T </gi//i/>]]$ is never a type synonym, though it could
be a type function.
\end{itemize}

Is it a left projection or a right projection?

\gram{\ottLorR}

Axioms:

\gram{
\ottC\ottinterrule
\ottaxBranch
}

\subsection{Type constructors}

Type constructors in GHC contain \emph{lots} of information. We leave most of it out
for this formalism:

\gram{\ottT}

We include some representative primitive type constructors. There are many more in \ghcfile{prelude/TysPrim.lhs}.

\gram{\ottH}

\section{Contexts}

The functions in \ghcfile{coreSyn/CoreLint.lhs} use the \texttt{LintM} monad.
This monad contains a context with a set of bound variables $[[G]]$. The
formalism treats $[[G]]$ as an ordered list, but GHC uses a set as its
representation.

\gram{
\ottG
}

We assume the Barendregt variable convention that all new variables are
fresh in the context. In the implementation, of course, some work is done
to guarantee this freshness. In particular, adding a new type variable to
the context sometimes requires creating a new, fresh variable name and then
applying a substitution. We elide these details in this formalism, but
see \coderef{types/Type.lhs}{substTyVarBndr} for details.

\section{Judgments}

The following functions are used from GHC. Their names are descriptive, and they
are not formalized here: \coderef{types/TyCon.lhs}{tyConKind},
\coderef{types/TyCon.lhs}{tyConArity}, \coderef{basicTypes/DataCon.lhs}{dataConTyCon}, \coderef{types/TyCon.lhs}{isNewTyCon}, \coderef{basicTypes/DataCon.lhs}{dataConRepType}.

\subsection{Program consistency}

Check the entire bindings list in a context including the whole list. We extract
the actual variables (with their types/kinds) from the bindings, check for duplicates,
and then check each binding.

\ottdefnlintCoreBindings{}

Here is the definition of $[[vars_of]]$, taken from \coderef{coreSyn/CoreSyn.lhs}{bindersOf}:

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
[[vars_of n = e]] &= [[n]] \\
[[vars_of rec </ ni = ei // i />]] &= [[</ ni // i />]]
\end{array}
\]

\subsection{Binding consistency}

\ottdefnlintXXbind{}

\ottdefnlintSingleBinding{}

In the GHC source, this function contains a number of other checks, such
as for strictness and exportability. See the source code for further information.

\subsection{Expression typing}

\ottdefnlintCoreExpr{}

%\arraylabel{\coderef{coreSyn/CoreLint.lhs}{checkCaseAlts}} \\
%\multicolumn{2}{l}{[[checkCaseAlts]] \text{ checks ordering and exhaustivity constr%aints}} \\

%\end{array}
%\]

\begin{itemize}
\item Some explication of \ottdrulename{Tm\_LetRec} is helpful: The idea behind the
second premise ($[[</ G, G'i |-ty s'i : ki // i />]]$) is that we wish
to check each substituted type $[[s'i]]$ in a context containing all the types
that come before it in the list of bindings. The $[[G'i]]$ are contexts
containing the names and kinds of all type variables (and term variables,
for that matter) up to the $i$th binding. This logic is extracted from
\coderef{coreSyn/CoreLint.lhs}{lintAndScopeIds}.

\item There is one more case for $[[G |-tm e : t]]$, for type expressions.
This is included in the GHC code but is elided
here because the case is never used in practice. Type expressions
can only appear in arguments to functions, and these are handled
in \ottdrulename{Tm\_AppType}.

\item The GHC source code checks all arguments in an application expression
all at once using \coderef{coreSyn/CoreSyn.lhs}{collectArgs}
and \coderef{coreSyn/CoreLint.lhs}{lintCoreArgs}. The operation
has been unfolded for presentation here.

\item If a $[[tick]]$ contains breakpoints, the GHC source performs additional
(scoping) checks.

\item The rule for $[[case]]$ statements also checks to make sure that
the alternatives in the $[[case]]$ are well-formed with respect to the
invariants listed above. These invariants do not affect the type or
evaluation of the expression, so the check is omitted here.

\item The GHC source code for \ottdrulename{Tm\_Var} contains checks for
a dead id and for one-tuples. These checks are omitted here.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Kinding}

\ottdefnlintType{}

\subsection{Kind validity}

\ottdefnlintKind{}

\subsection{Coercion typing}

\ottdefnlintCoercion{}

In \ottdrulename{Co\_AxiomInstCo}, the use of $[[inits]]$ creates substitutions from
the first $i$ mappings in $[[ </ [ni |-> si] // i /> ]]$. This has the effect of 
folding the substitution over the kinds for kind-checking.

\subsection{Name consistency}

There are two very similar checks for names, one declared as a local function:

\ottdefnlintSingleBindingXXlintBinder{}

\ottdefnlintBinder{}

\subsection{Substitution consistency}

\ottdefncheckTyKind{}

\subsection{Case alternative consistency}

\ottdefnlintCoreAlt{}

\subsection{Telescope substitution}

\ottdefnapplyTys{}

\subsection{Case alternative binding consistency}

\ottdefnlintAltBinders{}

\subsection{Arrow kinding}

\ottdefnlintArrow{}

\subsection{Type application kinding}

\ottdefnlintXXapp{}

\subsection{Sub-kinding}

\ottdefnisSubKind{}

\subsection{Branched axiom conflict checking}

The following judgment is used within \ottdrulename{Co\_AxiomInstCo} to make
sure that a type family application cannot unify with any previous branch
in the axiom.

\ottdefncheckXXnoXXconflict{}

The judgment $[[apart]]$ checks to see whether two lists of types are surely apart.
It checks to see if \coderef{types/Unify.lhs}{tcApartTys} returns \texttt{SurelyApart}.
Two types are apart if neither type is a type family application and if they do not
unify.
